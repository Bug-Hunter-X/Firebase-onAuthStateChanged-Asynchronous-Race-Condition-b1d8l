This repository demonstrates a common asynchronous race condition encountered when using Firebase Authentication's `onAuthStateChanged` listener. The issue stems from the fact that the listener doesn't guarantee immediate execution after a successful login.  This can lead to null pointer exceptions or unexpected behavior if subsequent code depends on the user's data being immediately available. The solution showcases a robust approach to mitigate this race condition by using promises or async/await to ensure the user data is fully loaded before proceeding.
