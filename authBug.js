The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger immediately after a successful authentication, resulting in an asynchronous race condition where subsequent code relying on the authenticated user's data might execute before the user's data is fully loaded or the user object is completely initialized. This often manifests as null or undefined values being unexpectedly accessed or used.
